# Heartbeat Sound Visualization

I create this notebook which contains a script that creates visualizations of heartbeat sounds. The script goes through the "Normal" and "Abnormal" folders, reads the .wav files, converts them into frames using numpy, and then plots the frames using matplotlib. This script can be useful for anyone who wants to analyze and visualize heartbeat sounds for research, medical, or educational purposes.

- Enables easy and quick visualization of heartbeat sounds
- Can be used for research, medical, or educational purposes
- Useful for analyzing and understanding heartbeat sounds
- Can be used to create a heartbeat sound dataset


## Installation

Clone this repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahSofts/heartbeatsoundvisualization.git
```

Install the required packages using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Make sure all the required packages (NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed. If you're not sure, just try running the script - it will let you know if there are any missing packages.

- Open the Python notebook containing the Heartbeat Sound Visualization script.

- The script will automatically search for two folders in the same directory: 'Normal' and 'Abnormal'. These folders should already contain two .wav files each. If you're feeling adventurous and want to add more files, just drop them into the appropriate folder.

- Run the script in the notebook.

- Sit back and enjoy the show! The script will process each .wav file and generate a stunning visualization of the heartbeat sound. You'll see a image for each file displayed in the notebook output.

## Result

The script will process each .wav file from both folders and generate a stunning visualization of the heartbeat sound.
